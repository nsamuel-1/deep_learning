# Deep_Learning

This repository contains deep learning projects covering image classification, sentiment analysis, and time series forecasting using neural networks. Each project demonstrates the application of different architectures such as feedforward networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models.

## Contents

1. **MNIST Digit Classifier** — Predict handwritten digits using a basic neural network
2. **Fashion MNIST Classifier** — Classify clothing items using a densely connected neural network
3. **IMDB Sentiment Analysis** — Analyze movie reviews and plot model accuracy using a subset of the IMDB dataset
4. **Penguin Species Classification** — Apply CNNs to classify penguin types based on visual features
5. **Stock Prediction with LSTM** — Use LSTM networks to explore techniques used in predicting stock buy/sell signals

Each project includes code, visualizations, and training results
